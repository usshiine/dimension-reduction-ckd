# dimension_reduction_ckd
This project aims to carry out dimensionality reduction on datasets to predict chronic kidney disease and can be collected from hospitals in a period of almost 2 months.

# Instructions for use:
1. Before creating a prediction model, download the dataset first at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease
2. Download or import this repository then modify the file address according to its location.
3. After that, run the model you want to use with the specified dataset file address.
4. Pay attention to the differences between the two models that were created before dimension reduction using PCA and after dimension reduction using PCA.
5. Confusion matrix, precision, recall, f1-score and accuracy are some of the final result metrics from the model evaluation process which can later be analyzed according to needs.
